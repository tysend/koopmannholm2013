My dissertation examines how early American minimalist compositions (including works by [La Monte Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-Ddu3TQx0) and [Philip Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK_oIoVJaew)) were experienced as low arousal positive valance affective states (LAP) in the 1960s and early 1970s. In addition to historical and cultural work showing the music's associations with meditation and Eastern thought, the project will also include a set of studies (under the guidance of Dr. Jeanne Tsai) on the role of ideal affect in aesthetic judgements of minimalist works (where ideal affect is the way we want to feel as opposed to actual affect, the way we actually feel). My replication project looks at Koopmann-Holm's 2013 Study 1 on the differences in the idealization of LAP states between meditators and nonmeditators. Their finding that meditators value LAP states more than nonmeditators informs my hypothesis that minimalist audience members with interest in non-musical LAP activities were more likely to enjoy minimalist compositions. 

Koopmann-Holm's study had 43 Buddhist-inspired meditators and 48 nonmeditators complete a series of online tasks:
1. an abridged Affect Valuation Index (AVI),
1. a demographic questionnaire, and
1. meditators also completed an assessment of their meditation practice.
The main statistical test was a set of ANCOVAs that found that meditators value LAP states more and high arousal positive states (HAP) less than nonmeditators. There were no significant differences between meditators and nonmeditators in actual affect.

The primary challenges might be:
1. learning how to use MTurk (this will be my first time),
1. finding enough Buddhist-inspired meditators on MTurk,
1. running ANCOVAs (a new test for me),
1. obtaining the questionnaires in a timely fashion.
